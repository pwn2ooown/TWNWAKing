## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm TWNWAKing, a weak script kiddie. Currently studying at department of Computer Science and Information Engineering at National Cheng Kung University.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **information security research**. And I also do CTF challenges, especially pwn (binary exploitation) challenges. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning software development, cybersecurity, data structure, algorithm, how to open source and a lot of miscellaneous stuff. I'm still a newbie in computer science now so I'm trying to learn as wide as I can.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My nickname TWNWAKing comes from the Wrong Answer King of competitive programming in TaiWaN. TWN + WA + King.
- ðŸ¤” Still struggling with ~~math in college~~.
